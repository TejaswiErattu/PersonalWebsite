The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that contains the icon image for the website. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as "favicon.ico" in the specified directory.

Please ensure that the favicon.ico file is placed in the /tejaswi-portfolio/tejaswi-portfolio/public/ directory.
